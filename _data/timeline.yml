  description: The Italian real estate market is not only very different from the US but its complexity and opacity result in a lack of com-prehensive public data on home values. This personal project, developed during my visting at CSDS, seeks to close this gapby introducing home value estimates from web-scraped and crowdsourced open data. It seeks to improve the accuracy ofpredicting home prices using a spatial hedonic model with such data. A new statistical, economic and IT approach to spatialhedonic price modelling is introduced to assess the quality of crowdsourced data from the internet. The project tests thefeasibility of an infrastructure capable of scraping the data and analyzing it in real time.
