# Abstract
We propose an augmented version of the traditional SIRD epidemic model and we estimate its parameters using the SaRs-Cov-2 Italian open-data. The modelâ€™s parameters are estimated partly using numerical optimization and partly with ABC. Our estimation procedure provides a good fit to real data.
